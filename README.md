<h1>So, what's happening here?</h1>

<p align='justify' style="font-weight: bold;">
What's happening here is a gradient boosting framework which is called as <b>'Light GBM'</b> that uses on old well known 'Decission Tree' 
learning algorithm which comes under the more well-known umberella term 'Machine Learning'. I've trained a learning model on SBA Loans Dataset 
and now place myself as a 'Bank Officer at USA' and receive a loan application from a small business. To make the decission, I will 
use <a style="color:rgb(0, 90, 71) ;"><b>Loan Predictor</b></a> to help me to classify the risk of the loan which is a high risk or low risk Loan.

Deeper on Loan Predictor evaluation, the accuracy of this model algorithm is ~90% and has AUC Score 0.97 which means that it is an ideal situation. 
When two curves donâ€™t overlap at all means model has an ideal measure of separability. 
It is nearly perfectly able to distinguish between positive class and negative class. 
But, it still has a limitation that only works for the loan that has guarantee from <a href="https://www.sba.gov" style="color:rgb(0, 90, 71) ;"><b>US Small Business Administration</b></a>.

The U.S. SBA was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market. 
Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. 
One way SBA assists these small business enterprises is through a loan guarantee program which is designed to encourage banks to grant loans to small businesses. 
SBA acts much like an insurance provider to reduce the risk for a bank by taking on some of the risk through guaranteeing a portion of the loan. 
In the case that a loan goes into default, SBA then covers the amount they guaranteed. 
There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. 
However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans. 
  The rate of default on these loans has been a source of controversy for decades.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2018.1434342">[Reference]</a></p>

NOTES : On the dashboard, to load the final dataset, I use two choices. Use sql connector to load from SQL Databases or load manually using pandas. <a href="https://github.com/agunggnug/Final_Project_PWDK/blob/master/Dashboard/model_plots.py"> Looks here </a>
